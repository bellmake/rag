The DASH diet  is an evidence-based eating plan that can help reduce high blood  pressure. This plan may also decrease the risk of heart attack,  stroke, diabetes, osteoporosis, and certain cancers.3  DASH tips to lower sodium include:  • Using spices instead of salt to add flavor  • Reading sodium content on processed or canned food labels,  and choosing low-sodium options  • Removing some sodium from canned foods (such as beans) by  rinsing the product before consumption  • Avoiding salt when cooking  DASH dieters are recommended to consume a variety of whole  grains and high-fiber fruits and vegetables, and moderate amounts  of low-fat dairy products, lean meats, and heart-healthy fish. In  addition, DASH limits the use of saturated fats to less than 7 percent  of total calories, and limits the consumption of sweets and alcohol.  The DASH diet also calls for consuming less added sugar and  drinking fewer sugar-sweetened drinks. It replaces red meat with  fish and legumes and calls for increased calcium, magnesium,  potassium, and fiber. Also, even though some people on the DASH  diet may find it lowers their HDL (good) cholesterol along with their  3. DASH Diet Eating Plan. DASH Diet Oregon.   http://www.dashdietoregon.org/.

There is more consistent evidence from observational  studies that a higher intake of vitamin E from foods is linked to a  decreased risk of dying from a heart attack.

These can be metabolically  processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients  comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is  converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work,  allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of  measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels  the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie  multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories,  denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a  capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in  the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other  macronutrients, it does not yield calories.  Carbohydrates  Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and  oxygen. The major food sources of carbohydrates are grains, milk,  fruits, and starchy vegetables, like potatoes. Non-starchy vegetables  also contain carbohydrates, but in lesser quantities. Carbohydrates  are broadly classified into two forms based on their chemical  structure: simple carbohydrates, often called simple sugars; and  complex carbohydrates.  Simple carbohydrates consist of one or two basic units. Examples  of simple sugars include sucrose, the type of sugar you would have  in a bowl on the breakfast table, and glucose, the type of sugar that  circulates in your blood.
